2. Add Korean Rock-Paper-Scissors called Mugjjippa.

     - Make Help button for knowing How to play the game.
      
3. Add life System. So Players can choose their life.
     
     - We realized that it was difficult for us to set lives. So we locked lives. When the player loses 3 times, the game ends and a pop-up opens.
  
4. Add Rank System. Players can see the highest score among those who have played the same life.

5. Add Gamble System. When you win the game, you can get money that the pointer points.
