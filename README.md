## About Our Project...
We are based on the following project... https://github.com/lacrossebjorne/RockPaperScissors

We will add some functions and make application look beautiful.

## We are Digimonchingudle

## Goal of this Project

1. Making a very simple game application which can play whenever and wherever. 

2. Add Korean Rock-Paper-Scissors called Mugjjippa.

     - Make Help button for knowing How to play the game.
      
3. Add life System. So Players can choose their life.
     
     - (delete) We realized that it was difficult for us to set lives. So we locked lives. When the player loses 3 times, the game ends and a pop-up opens.
     - (2016-12-04) You can set your life when you click 'Life Setting' button on main activity. You can only enter number and if you dont enter anything, you will see a Toast that says "Please Enter". Life value set by default is 3.
  
4. Add Rank System. Players can see the highest score among those who have played the same life.

5. Add Gamble System. When you win the game, you can get money that the pointer points.
