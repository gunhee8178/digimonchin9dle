## Goal of this Project

1. Making a very simple game application which can play whenever and wherever. 
     
     - 심심할때 하면 나름 시간 때우기 좋은 그런 게임을 만들고 싶습니다.
     
2. Making the completive game like the games in playstore or appstore.       
      - 장풍키우기라는 게임이 플레이스토에 있는데 그 게임은 그래픽도 게임 구조도 간단하지만 상당히 완성도가 높았다. 
      우리의 게임도 간단해도 완성도가 높은 어플로 언젠가 플레이스토어에 올려보고 싶다.

3. Applying neat design.

     -

     - Make Help button for knowing How to play the game. 
     
     - (delete) We realized that it was difficult for us to set lives. So we locked lives. When the player loses 3           times, the game ends and a pop-up opens.
     - (2016-12-04) You can set your life when you click 'Life Setting' button on main activity. You can only enter number and if you dont enter anything, you will see a Toast that says "Please Enter". Life value set by default is 3.
